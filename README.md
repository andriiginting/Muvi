In this project I'm using MVVM - Clean Architecture. By implementing clean architecture, it will give us :  
- clean separation of concern; making your code easier to navigate and maintain
- easier to test the code

How to use it?
------
- Clone this project using `git clone [url]`
- build the project by using `./gradlew clean :app:assembleDebug`
- You can run the Unit test by using `./gradlew clean test`

*Clean Architecture will not be appropriate for every project, so it is down to you to decide whether or not it fits your needs*
